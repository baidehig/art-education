                    <p class="m-0">Art  classes in school were the 'fun' classes. They were scheduled on Saturday after the sports class, so you could rest and 'chill'.  I would drink cold water, gossip with friends and happily walk back to the bus in a hurry to reach home. I guess it was not much different for my art teacher too: she would carry papers to grade in class, knit sweaters or just stand at the door of the classroom to share school gossip with the next door class teacher. The last period on Saturday was art class for the whole school anyway. Whenever exams came closer, these classes would get canceled or reallocated to serious subjects like science or math, not to social sciences though. 

My art teacher didn't change from class 2nd to 8th, after which I didn't have art as a subject, even the classes didn't change much. We were supposed to draw what we 'felt' like, it started with drawing fruits, flowers, and ended somewhere at drawing landscapes. We were not exactly taught to 'do’ art. If you were good at it, you would receive praise from the teacher, and some “ooohs” and “awwws” from the students. If you drew 'badly', you would be getting a lot of “hahahahas” and “oh gods”. But that was it, art classes ended with these expressions and some fun, they didn't mean more or less but just enough to make it a subject in school. I was horrible at it, I didn't think I cared much too, after all I was really good at science and math!

                    <p class="m-0">We had Drawing and Craft periods in school right upto 10th standard. But our school was more focused on academic rigor related to theoretical subjects like History and practical subjects like Maths. Creative subjects like Drawing were not given much importance. We were taught a variety of techniques in drawing and painting and given different assignments each period. Same was the case with Craft classes. I remember being taught watercolor, oil painting, memory drawing, still life etc. In Craft, we were taught quilling, flower-making etc. There wasn't encouragement given for unhindered creativity and innovation.

We had an art exam in 8th standard and a lot of students from our school participated in it. It was a tough exam with only one student from amongst 40 + students receiving A grade. In Junior KG, my teacher knew that I liked to draw and asked me to design a poster she had made. Thereafter, my interests shifted to academics and writing, and Drawing period became quite a chore for me.

                    <p class="m-0">Art used to be one of my favourite classes in school because it did not require me to mug up lessons or compete with my friends to score the highest. It was the one subject which was considered as somewhat unimportant by my parents and that precisely made me like it the most. I loved playing with colours and charcoal. I wasn't exactly a person who conformed to conventional art and that sometimes irked my teacher. I was more of an 'abstract' art person whose paintings did not have any meaning as such. This was not considered proper and eventually, over the years, I too started making conventional paintings of houses, trees, rivers and flowers. Now that I think about it, I feel the definition of art is very restrictive in schools. Art is supposed to be something personal and it need not make sense all the time. But the way art is taught in most schools curbs the creativity of children. Having been a student of an art school as well, I have observed how students are forced to practice a particular painting style because that fetches better scores. Somehow, the art pedagogy of our country dilutes the fun and creativity of the subject.</p>

                    <p class="m-0">My earliest memory of art in school is painting a cardboard postbox (that we had made with the help of our teachers) red. I think we were about 5 years old. There was a lot of art in my early school life since the institution believed in learning through tactile experiences and play. We tried madhubani, worli, potato and onion stamping, marbling with paints and turpentine oil, even carpentry and clay modeling. But by middle school I had moved cities and formal art education was restricted to paintings. Though I did learn to use oil pastels during this time, which was great! 

Later, I chose Commercial Art as an elective and got to make books, try product paintings, make word art and learn the basics of photography, all of which I greatly enjoyed. Unfortunately, our system prioritized examinations over all others so either one switched to Fine Art and Art Theory or left art altogether and focused on the boards. I didn't pick the former, so I didn't get to experience any form of art education in the last two years of school. Still, what little I did, I greatly enjoyed and found solace in!
