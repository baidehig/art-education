                    <p class="mb-5">Art as a subject is mandatory for students up until class tenth in most Indian schools. The National Curricular Framework 2005 talks about the intention behind the same and the values that art education is expected to help inculcate in the students. </p>
<p>As per the curriculum, through art education, “students must be introduced to the rich and varied artistic traditions of the country.” Although this statement does not mention any specific content or pedagogical methods to be used for the same, to me, it would have involved learning about the different traditions present in the various Indian states, the stories behind them, and the way art played a role in ensuring that these traditions and stories were passed down over the generations. However, there is very little talk about all of these things. According to existing literature, the present-day practices of pedagogy employed in Indian schools tend to overlap with the system of colonial art education and the components taught within it. By attempting to recognize Indian art forms and introduce them to students, the curriculum is trying to move past the colonial hangover. However, while the curriculum talks about it, at least on paper, there is a lot of ground to be covered in terms of action. </p>
<p>The curriculum also states that, “Throughout the years of school, during all stages, the mediums and forms of art allow children to develop both a playful as well as a disciplined exploration of themselves and diverse materials, and allows them to experiment with many forms of expression.” The words “exploration” and “experiment”  imply a certain degree of freedom to think and venture beyond the given brief, one that is absent in the way art is presently taught in schools. However, it would also include imparting the basic technical skills required for allowing students to then explore and experiment beyond them, as denoted through the term “disciplined exploration”. Inculcating a component into the curriculum that provides a medium through which students can get to know themselves better could be the first step to addressing these problems. Additionally, introducing students to the concept of visual expression using art by simply allowing them to draw what they want can give them the opportunity to explore their emotions, as well as illustrate, codify, and represent what they learn in other subjects.</p>
<p>Lastly, while talking about pedagogy, the curriculum states that the approach employed to teach art in schools needs to be “participatory, interactive, and experiential rather than instructive.” However, to what extent is this followed in schools? The instructive method of teaching currently followed in schools leaves no space for questions, conversations, or independent thought. Adopting a participatory and interactive form of teaching can encourage students to contextualize their learnings, think about the psychological, social, and cultural aspects of their experiences, and venture beyond the set template decided by the teacher.</p>
<p>The current system of grading and assessment is based on how well students are able to follow instructions and secondly, the extent of the accuracy of a particular replication. These criteria are limited, focus solely on technical aspects, and are interpreted in a narrow manner, all in an attempt to achieve standardization. While the ‘how’ or the form of art is an important aspect of art education, the present pedagogy and assessment place undue emphasis on it, thus compromising meaning, interaction, thought, content, and conversation in the process. 
Therefore, there is a clear and visible gap between what making art mandatory in the school curriculum was supposed to do, and what it has been able to achieve. The problem has numerous components to it of which, teachers, students, the syllabus, pedagogical methods, and the assessment criteria are the major ones, with each component being as important a contributor as the other. The gap needs to be addressed and bridged, but how? This website is a small first step in that direction.
